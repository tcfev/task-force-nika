# Transparency Protocol:

* all the decision making procedures will be recorded
* anonymized versions of the protocols will be made public
* Sensitive materials are materials that could put entities at harm or help our adversaries sabotage our mission.
* We add secret salt to names and sensitive information and make a SHA1 Hash.
* The information and the hash are saved in a secret table for later reveal. 
* The information is released when the threat no longer exists
* Redacted data are rechecked with board members every month for decision re. revealing with TCF e.V.â€™s members 


 ## Implementation details
*  We track in minutes of the sessions when a member leaves the meeting. This way these individuals will get inform themselves after they access the total minutes.
