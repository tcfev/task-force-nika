# Transparency Protocol

* All the decision making procedures will be recorded
* Anonymized versions of the protocols will be made public
  * Sensitive materials are materials that could put entities at harm or help our adversaries sabotage our mission.
  * We add secret salt to names and sensitive information and make a SHA1 Hash.
  * The information and the hash are saved in a secret table for later reveal. 
  * The information is released when the threat no longer exists
  * Redacted data are rechecked with board members every month for decision re. revealing with non-board members. This is because of the fact that our security screening is tight but the process of becoming a member & starting ones work is relatively lax.


 ## Implementation details
*  We track in minutes of the sessions when a member leaves the meeting. This way these individuals will get to inform themselves after they access the final minutes.
